# Agri-Vision AI 🌱

An end-to-end deep learning application that identifies plant diseases from leaf images, enabling early intervention and reducing crop loss. Built with convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deployed as a user-friendly web application for gardeners, farmers and agricultural consultants.

## 🎯 Features

- **Disease Detection**: Accurately identifies various plant diseases from leaf images
- **Deep Learning Powered**: Uses CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for image classification
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple web application for easy image upload and diagnosis
- **Early Intervention**: Helps farmers and gardeners take timely action to prevent crop loss
- **Fast Results**: Quick analysis and diagnosis of plant health issues

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning**: Deep Learning with CNN
- **Computer Vision**: Image processing and classification
- **Web Framework**: For deploying the application interface
